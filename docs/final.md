Project link: https://cs326-final-project.herokuapp.com/

Our application is aiming at stressed people in everyday life no matter from all walks of life. This life is just too harsh and fast-paced for people to have a moment to sit down and have their own time. This app takes such inspiration and hopes to bring about some or even small happiness to lighten up their days. This application also practice simplistic design patterns with a hope that users will find no difficulty using the website. Our application include easy sign-up and log-in allowing different profiles for users. We have a wide range of activities for users to choose from: Breathing in and out, Random meme generator, Mood chart, Listening to music, and Watching videos. We allow a lot of options for users to have a diverse experience using this app, also it is simple enough not to overwhelm them as many official apps out in the market.

# Division of Labor:

The idea of each feature is from everyone, Thai is mainly front-end, Duy and Thanh are mainly back-end. That being said, everyone contributes roughly the same in every stage.

# Conclusion:

Conclusion: A conclusion describing your teamâ€™s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.

Our team works very well as each person has their own strength. The biggest problem we faced was the time zone issue. It was kind of hard for us to communicate the most effectively when there are a big different between time zones (12 hours difference) for members though we still got through such problems with adequate communication. the project is sure to be one of the biggest valuable lesson we have in college as a Computer Science major. The design part took an enormous amount, including getting ideas rejected, modying ideas several times, deciding on features for our application. Design is needed the ability of telling a story and emphathize the difference in users which we try to show that in our product. There are a lot of small details of components that we did not really know about, especially using apis and incorporate it onto our design though we did learn about apis, but we never really care about the user interface aspect of it and now we have to do it. There are some fun timing feature in css and js that we also discover that is very advanced.

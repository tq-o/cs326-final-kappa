Subtitle: The subtitle should be your application name (if different from team name).
Semester: The semester (e.g., Fall 2020)
Overview: A brief overview of your application. This will be based on what you are submitting as your final web application artifact. You should also mention why your application is innovative.
Team Members: A list of your team members, with names and GitHub aliases.
User Interface: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.

# Semester:
Fall 2020
# Overview:
Our application is aiming at stressed people in everyday life no matter from all walks of life. This life is just too harsh and fast-paced for people to have a moment to sit down and have their own time. This app takes such inspiration and hopes to bring about some or even small happiness to lighten up their days.

Our team works very well as each person has their own strength. The biggest problem we faced was the time zone issue. It was kind of hard for us to communicate the most effectively when there are a big different between time zones (12 hours difference) for members though we still got through such problems with adequate communication. the project is sure to be one of the biggest valuable lesson we have in college as a Computer Science major. The design part took an enormous amount, including getting ideas rejected, modying ideas several times, deciding on features for our application. Design is needed the ability of telling a story and emphathize the difference in users which we try to show that in our product. There are a lot of small details of components that we did not really know about, especially using apis and incorporate it onto our design though we did learn about apis, but we never really care about the user interface aspect of it and now we have to do it. There are some fun timing feature in css and js that we also discover that is very advanced.

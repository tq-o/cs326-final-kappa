# Data Interactions
* The app will have a login page for users. Therefore each user can have the option to customize the color/theme of the app. 
* Then there will be functions to guide them through the relaxation practices.
* Generally, there will be step 1, 2, 3 in order,... 
* The specifics of the steps will need more research, but for now, we expect a breath in-out activity, calm sound to relax, quick exercise visualization (maybe by words or pictures) ,and random motivation popup words for the users. The list will have to be changed later for uniqueness and innovation.
* The list will have to be changed later for uniqueness and innovation.
* The user will have the chance to input in an opening survey of how they relax with the list of activities we have in these projects, 
and from that build the correct steps for them. Based on the number of times they used the app, 
there will be collected points to unlocked special features (maybe a special song playlist/videos).
